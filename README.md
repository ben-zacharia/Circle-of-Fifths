# Circle-of-Fifths

Simple Circle of Fifths app

Some things missing - There are currently only audio examples for C major and A minor

                    - You can only reverse the melodic minor scale, this is the only 
                      one where the notes change, but it would be nice to see the rest reverse too
                      
                    - It would be very nice if the wheel could turn, but I have not yet found an elegant way to do that
